      <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
      <p>I graduated from Strathclyde in 2016 and worked in a graduate scheme for a few years before moving to work in The Wise Group as an employment advisor on a 6 month contract. I have now embarked on a Software Development Course which runs one day per week on a Saturday. I am looking for part-time employment to support my studies. I am a reliable employee, always punctual and a good communicator.

      <h2>Employment History</h2>
      <h4>Employment Advisor</h4>
      <p>at The Wise Group<br>This six-month contract gave me experience in the non-profit sector. I managed a caseload of participants on the UK
employability program JETS. I supported people with all aspects of their journey into work after periods of unemployment.
The participants generally faced multiple barriers and we worked together to find creative solutions that suited their
individual needs.</p>
      <h4>Finance Analyst</h4>
      <p>at Rolls-Royce Inchinnan<br>I managed the collection, verification and analysis of a range of data required for financial accounting purposes. This
included detailed reports on spending and also covered operational data such as stock and inventory levels, scrap rates,
quality controls and turn-around time. I fed this data into the relevant teams for their consideration in the management of
operations. The scope to influence processes and enact change was limited in this role and when voluntary
severance was offerred in August 2020 I left Rolls-Royce to explore a new career path.</p>
      <h4>Business Improvement Manager
      <p>at Rolls-Royce Inchinnan</br>I promoted improvement activity at a site, departmental and cell level by influencing colleagues and senior leaders to
embrace lean behaviours and value Continuous Improvement. I was responsible for coaching the Green Belt projects on site
and ensuring that these individual projects delivered the strategic business plan by facilitating monthly Business Plan
Deployment meetings with the senior site leaders. I delivered one workstream of a larger project where I was responsible
for a spend of £3m, working closely with all stakeholders and hosting a variety of workshops. Immersing myself in all
aspects of operations, I challenged myself and those around me to perform at our best and to act with consistency and
integrity across a number of challenging scenarios.</p>
      <h4>Material Resource Planning Controller</h4>
      <p>at Rolls-Royce Sheffield<br>A planning and control role supporting delivery and inventory, I worked with the PP&C manager on long, mid and short
term strategy decisions. I monitored weekly output and represented the PP&C work stream in the Project Management
meetings for a project to double the capacity of our facility. I installed a control centre to monitor throughput and
operational factors leading to over- or under-production using DMADV principles. This drove strategic decision making at
daily operations meetings, enforcing the Rolls-Royce behavioural competency “act on data, not gut feel”.</p>
      <h4>Quality Analyst</h4>
      <p>at Rolls-Royce Indianapolis<br>I finalised and published a Global Procedure (for all Rolls-Royce businesses) on counterfeit parts with agreement from the
leaders of all sectors and functions. Two days per week, I delivered a DMAIC Green Belt improvement project on visual
management in the manufacturing plant, redefining KPIs and automating the data-management system. With a full-time
intern and the support of a number of colleagues the new system drives strong and strategic decision making at plant, cell
and workstation levels.</p>
     <h4>Strategic Buyer</h4><p>at Rolls-Royce Derby<br>Refining my negotiation skills and gaining a strong understanding supply chain management, I worked closely with a cross-
functional team to source ducting, gimbals and pipes across a number of sourcing projects. I relied on the Engineering department to confirm technical capability of new suppliers and I worked closely with the Finance team to understand the
corporate financial predictions and to account for the risk appetites determined at a company level. I presented sourcing
decisions to my managers for packages of value £1m to £20m.</p>
